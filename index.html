            <h1 class="used">Used Cars</h1>
            <p>When you first get your drivers license, you dream of buying your first car. However, a brand new car can cost upwards of $30,000. A lot of people do not have that money and that is why used cars are the best option. Used Cars are essentially driven and previously owned by someone else. That person then decides to sell that car below the original price.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="new">New Cars</h1>
            <p>Usually, people buy new cars once they have a job and have saved up enough money. New cars are expensive because they need proper inspection, maintainance fees, down payments, and insurance. The cost begins to pile up. There are plenty of car brands out in the market and there will always be options to buy.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="future">Futiristic Cars</h1>
            <p>In the world of technology, there isn't any doubt that cars will be seeing some changes. We have also began to see some changes as there are self driving cars. However, we may see flying cars sooner rather than later. Many different companies are looking towards the future to improve and succeed, especially Merecedes.</p>
